# Frequently Asked Questions

## Essentials

> What do I need to sign up for MyOrderApp?

To sign up for MyOrderApp, you need:

- A valid email address, or an existing Google or Apple account.
- An active Square account with at least one registered location, complete with business hours, and an established catalog.
- A valid credit card, which is necessary even if you opt for the free tier, to cover any potential transaction fees that may apply.

> How does MyOrderApp integrate with Square?

MyOrderApp leverages Square's OAuth system to establish a secure connection with your Square account. This authentication process grants MyOrderApp permission to access and synchronize data with your Square setup. Once authorized, any updates in your Square account—be it changes in the catalog, item variations, or business hours—are automatically communicated to MyOrderApp's servers. Conversely, when customers place orders through your MyOrderApp-powered mobile app, these orders are seamlessly pushed to your Square account, maintaining a consistent and up-to-date flow of information. This integration ensures real-time synchronization between both platforms, providing a smooth operational experience for managing your orders and inventory.

> Can I preview my app before it goes live?

Absolutely, MyOrderApp provides you with the capability to preview your app at every step of the customization process. This means you can see in real time how your app is shaping up as you select your preferences for name, icon, color scheme, fonts, and more. Even after you’ve made your selections and post-launch, you can preview any changes you make before they go live. This ensures that your app always looks exactly how you want it to and offers the best experience for your customers.

> What are the steps to publish my app through MyOrderApp?

Once you've customized your app and are ready to go live, the subsequent steps depend on the publishing plan you've chosen.

If your plan includes an Android app:

- **Beta Invite**: Within 48 hours of selecting an Android-inclusive plan and completing checkout, you will receive a beta invite for your application. This is an opportunity to test and experience the app before it goes public.
- **Store Page Coordination**: Our team will collaborate with you to prepare the necessary screenshots and descriptions that will accompany your app on its Google Play Store page.

- **Google Play Submission**: Following your approval of these materials, we will submit your app to the Google Play Store for review.

For plans that include an iOS app:

- **Developer Account Options**: Our team will contact you to discuss setting up your Apple Developer Account. You have the option to create it yourself—and if you do, we'll credit back your first month's subscription—or you can allow us to set it up using the email you've provided. This step requires some coordination but is essential for the iOS app publication.

- **iOS Beta Build**: After your Apple Developer Account is active, we aim to provide you with an iOS beta build within 48 hours. This gives you an early look and the ability to confirm that everything in the app meets your expectations.

For both Android and iOS:

- **Review and Confirmation**: Once you've reviewed the beta version of your app and given us the green light, we'll proceed to send your app for review to both Apple and Google.

- **App Store Live**: The review process typically takes about one to two weeks, although it's often completed within just one week. After approval by the app stores, your app will be live and available to your customers.

Throughout this process, we maintain transparent communication and guide you through each step to ensure your app's successful launch.

> How can I personalize my mobile app with MyOrderApp?

You can easily personalize your mobile app in MyOrderApp by heading to the customize section. There, you'll enter a name for your app that truly speaks to your brand's identity. Next, you'll upload an icon that captures your business visually. After that, pick a seed color which will dictate the primary color scheme of your app, ensuring it matches your brand's palette. Then, you can choose from a variety of font families to find the one that fits your brand's style.

Further, you'll have the option to set the theme mode of your app—either to match the system settings of the user's device or to stick with a light or dark theme consistently. Lastly, select an appearance for your app—be it contemporary or modern—to best present your business to customers. The great thing is, as you make these choices, you'll see a live preview of what your app will look like, giving you a real-time glimpse into the user experience before your app goes live.

## Pricing and Plans:

> What are the differences between the pricing plans offered by MyOrderApp?

MyOrderApp offers three main pricing plans, each designed to cater to different stages of business growth and platform needs:

1. **Free Plan**: This plan is geared towards small businesses just starting out with mobile ordering. It includes access to a personalized web app with a 5% transaction fee per order. Support for the Free plan is guaranteed within 72 hours.

2. **Starter Plan**: Ideal for growing businesses that aim to establish an Android presence. This plan costs $29 per month with a reduced transaction fee of 2.5%. It includes everything in the Free plan plus the addition of an Android app. Support response times for the Starter plan are within 48 hours.

3. **Complete Plan**: This plan is for businesses seeking a comprehensive, multi-platform mobile ordering experience. Priced at $99 per month, it completely eliminates transaction fees and includes the features of the Starter Plan plus an iOS app. Priority support with response times within 24 hours is also included.

The key differences lie in the supported platforms (web, Android, iOS), the transaction fees, and the speed of the support response times. Each subsequent tier provides additional value in terms of reduced transaction costs, broader reach to customers across different devices, and quicker access to customer service.

> Does MyOrderApp charge additional transaction fees on top of Square's processing fees?

Yes, MyOrderApp imposes its own transaction fees in addition to Square's processing fees. For the Free tier, MyOrderApp charges a 5% transaction fee on the order subtotal, which does not include taxes and tips. For the Starter tier, which includes an Android app, the transaction fee is reduced to 2.5%. The Complete tier, offering a comprehensive package with web, iOS, and Android apps, does not have any transaction fees from MyOrderApp. These fees are exclusive of and separate from any processing fees that Square may charge for its services.

> What are the benefits of upgrading to the Starter plan on MyOrderApp?

Upgrading to the Starter plan on MyOrderApp includes all the features of the free version, plus it adds support for an Android app. This broader reach potentially increases customer engagement by providing a more convenient ordering option for Android users. The support response time for the Starter plan is also improved, with guarantees of within 48 hours.

> What additional features do I get with the Complete plan on MyOrderApp?

The Complete plan on MyOrderApp is the most feature-rich option. It includes everything in the Starter plan and adds iOS app support, which means you can offer your customers a native app experience on both major mobile platforms. The support for the Complete plan is the fastest, with a guaranteed response time within 24 hours, ensuring that any issues can be addressed promptly.

> Is there a free version of MyOrderApp available, and what does it include?

Yes, there is a free version of MyOrderApp available. It primarily includes the ability to create a web-based ordering platform that integrates with Square. This tier allows for the core functionalities needed to start accepting online orders but support response times are guaranteed only within 72 hours.

> Can I cancel or change my plan?

Your cancellation and plan change request can be managed directly through the MyOrderApp dashboard. If you decide to cancel a paid subscription, your account will revert to the free plan's transaction fee structure. The transition is designed to be smooth, providing a one-month grace period where your app continues to operate, albeit with higher transaction fees corresponding to the free tier. This period allows for customer notifications and any necessary arrangements for a new service if you choose to migrate. Keep in mind that changes to your plan will take effect immediately, but any benefits or increased fees will only come into play after the one-month period following a downgrade.

## Integration and Catalog Management:

> Will changes in my Square Catalog automatically update in MyOrderApp?

Yes, any changes you make to your Square Catalog will automatically update in MyOrderApp. The system is designed for real-time synchronization with Square, so typically updates occur almost instantaneously. However, there might be rare occasions during periods of high demand when Square may not send out notifications or permit immediate information retrieval. In such cases, to ensure that your mobile app reflects the latest changes, MyOrderApp conducts a manual sync for every merchant at 4 AM each morning. This guarantees that, at most, your app will be updated with any catalog changes by the start of each new business day.

> Will my app built with MyOrderApp work well on all devices and platforms?

By utilizing Google's Adaptive Scaffold system within the Flutter framework, MyOrderApp ensures that your application is not only aesthetically scalable across a multitude of devices but also maintains performance integrity. The system is engineered to provide a seamless user experience with smooth animations and responsive interactions, irrespective of the device's screen size. This is a key component of the Material Design philosophy, which places a strong emphasis on creating interfaces that are both functional and visually appealing on any platform. Flutter's performance is further enhanced by its ability to compile to native ARM code, which is crucial for ensuring that the app runs efficiently on each device, whether it's a high-end tablet or a mid-range smartphone, thereby guaranteeing that users experience swift and fluid performance across the board.

## Functionality and Customization:

> How does MyOrderApp handle notifications for orders?

MyOrderApp manages order notifications efficiently. When a customer places an order and opts in by providing their email or phone number, the system sends out notifications at various stages of the order process. The notifications are triggered by the order status updates received from Square. This means a notification is sent when an order is received at a location, and further notifications follow as the order status changes to in progress, ready for pickup, or when it has been picked up, according to the point of sale system updates. This ensures customers are kept informed in real-time about the status of their order.

> Can I set different pickup times for different items or days?

MyOrderApp currently offers a single setting for the minimum pickup lead time that applies across all items and business days. This setting, which can be adjusted via a support ticket on the merchant dashboard, defines the earliest pickup time relative to the business opening hours or to the time of order if it's an "ASAP" order during business hours. For example, with a 15-minute default lead time and a 10 AM opening, the earliest pickup would be at 10:15 AM. For an ASAP order placed at 2 PM, the earliest pickup would be 2:15 PM. Likewise, with a 6 PM closing time, the last order would need to be placed by 5:45 PM to meet the minimum lead time. As of now, MyOrderApp doesn't support setting different pickup times for individual items or specific days.

> Is it possible to accept orders outside of business hours?

MyOrderApp allows merchants to accept orders for future pickup dates by setting a maximum pickup advance number of days, which defaults to one week. This means that even after business hours, customers can place orders for any future date within the specified range, as long as the pickup time falls within your established business hours. When a customer places an order after closing, the earliest available pickup time would be right after the business opens on the next operational day, plus the minimum lead time, typically set at 15 minutes. For instance, if a business closes at 6 PM, a customer could still place an order for 10:15 AM the next day, assuming the business opens at 10 AM. This feature gives customers the flexibility to plan ahead and ensures that businesses can capture orders even when they're not currently open.

> How does MyOrderApp's multilingual support work?

MyOrderApp leverages the device's native APIs to automatically detect the user's preferred language setting and provides translations for system-generated text, such as buttons and titles, to offer a localized experience. However, the content that originates from the Square Catalog, including product names and descriptions, will remain in the language as they were entered into Square. This means while the interface elements can adapt to multiple languages for a more intuitive user experience, the merchant-supplied content's multilingual support would depend on the merchant's input.

## Support and Tools:

> What kind of support can I expect with each MyOrderApp pricing plan?

Support responsiveness varies with each MyOrderApp pricing plan. On the Free tier, you can expect support to be provided as it becomes available, with a response time guaranteed within 72 hours. For the Starter tier, the response time is faster, with support guaranteed within 48 hours. At the Pro level, which is the most comprehensive, the support is prioritized, with the fastest response time guaranteed within 24 hours. The commitment is to provide assistance as soon as possible within these time frames.

> What SEO and social media tools does MyOrderApp offer?

MyOrderApp provides basic SEO and social media tools. Each website can be configured with a custom social sharing image, meta title, and meta description to enhance its visibility on search engines and when shared on social platforms. As of now, these settings are adjusted by submitting a support ticket, but an update is underway to empower merchants with direct control over these elements through the platform interface. This feature rollout is anticipated to be complete by the first quarter of 2024, aiming to give users more autonomy in managing their app’s online presence.
